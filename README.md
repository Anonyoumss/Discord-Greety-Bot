# Discord-Greety-Bot

A bot that greets and says Hi to anybody who says HI or is new!

A Versatile and Friendly Discord Bot
This bot is a practical and welcoming addition to any Discord server, designed to streamline communication and enhance community interaction. Built using the discord.py library, it offers a suite of intuitive, natural-language features that are easy for any user to learn and enjoy.

Use Cases and How to Use It
The bot is perfect for any group, from small teams to large communities, that wants to add a touch of automation and organization to their server.

Friendly Responses: The bot recognizes and responds to common greetings ("hi", "hello") and farewells ("bye", "goodbye"), making the server feel more dynamic and engaging for new and old members alike.

Status Management: Users can quickly check on the availability of others. Typing "online" will list all members currently online, while "offline" will list those who are offline.

"Be Right Back" (BRB) System: If a user needs to step away, they can simply type "brb" or a similar phrase, and the bot will track their status. As soon as they send a new message, they are automatically removed from the BRB list, ensuring the information is always up-to-date.

Key Features and Technical Design
The bot's design prioritizes stability, security, and ease of deployment.

Replit Hosting: The bot is configured to run on Replit's platform, providing a free and accessible hosting environment.

24/7 Uptime: It uses a dedicated keep_alive.py utility to run a web server in the background, which prevents the bot from going idle and ensures it remains online around the clock.

Git Integration: The project is fully version-controlled with Git, allowing for easy updates. You can pull new changes directly from a GitHub repository to your Replit instance, simplifying maintenance and feature deployment.

Secure Token Handling: The bot's sensitive authentication token is stored securely as an environment variable within Replit, preventing it from being exposed in the code and protecting the application from unauthorized access.
